    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Recently finished Year 13, completing A Levels in Maths, Computer Science and Product Design. I enjoyed my chosen subjects very much which has reinforced to choose a software development career. I enjoy working as part of a team, I am a reliable, trustworthy, loyal and a conscientious person who is eager to develop further skills.</p>
    <p>Please note not all my projects are shown, I have only included my most unique/favourite projects.</p>
    <p>This portfolio was created to practice my basic HTML and CSS skills as I have not had to use HTML for a few years</p>

      <h3>C++ rewrite of Isometric Project - 2024</h3>
      <p>This project is a rewrite of my simple python Isometric game with building mechanics. The map is randomly generated at a size of 40x40. Noteable changes from the python version include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I removed the seperate controllable camera system used in the original, opting for camera to be centred around the player. </li>
        <li>The player now moves with the WASD keys, with the player image updating for the direction the player is facing. </li>
        <li>To build - left click.</li>
        <li>Vertical shifting (being able to move "up" and "down" the y axis to give the impression of being a layer above/below) has been removed. This was to simplify gameplay, and to allow more time to be spent on new features</li>
        <li>New materials were added - Solar block and Teleport Block.</li>
        <li>The Solar block generates power, which can then be used to place Teleport blocks. These materials are locked until the first objective has been completed.</li>
        <li>I added a inventory system to select what material to build with, replacing the previous method to swap material which involved using the number keys. The inventory is opened by pressing E, and you can then click on a chosen material, and press E to close the inventory. </li>
        <li>Added a objective system. The objective menu is visible when opening the inventory. This automaically updates once a listed objective is completed.</li>
        <li>Standing on the Teleport block is the final objective. This is the "end" of the game, completing the last objective to "Teleport". Currently nothing happens after you stand on the teleport, apart from the objective 4 completing. The intention would be for the game to end or change levels but as only one level exists at this stage of development, nothing happens as trying to switch to a level that doesn't exist would cause the game to crash  </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Python Raycaster - 2023-2024</h3>
      <p>For my computing A-level coursework, I created a raycasting project in python using the Pygame package and assets found online. Designed to replicate the rendering technique of Wolfenstein3D but have the visual style of DOOM 1993, my program has a unique visual design with customisable maps, modes and screen size.Whilst starting as a simple raycasting environment, I later added sprites, randomly generated maps, interactable areas of the map and more. This project achieved me nearly full marks for my coursework.</p>

      <h3>MicroPython PIR LED control System - 2024</h3>
      <p>This was designed for my Product Design A-Level coursework, to create a motion activated LED system. I coded it to be as simple as possible as it is only needed to control a LED strip, and I feared over complciating my code would create a higher chance of errors occuring. As the code was uploaded to a microcontroller, the whole system would have to be dismantled and desoldered to change the code if I found an error when testing. The system works as intended, activating the lights when the sensor detects motion and deactivating it when no more motion is detected. It uses a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller in a custom 3D printed enclosure. The PIR and LED are controlled by this microncontroller. Enclosure designed on Solidworks, and joined to the inside of the shelf to hide it. The PIR sensor has a seperate enclosure attatched to the Pico enclosure. These enclosures are shown by the technical drawing below. System works as intended.</p>

      <h3>Isometric Project - 2023</h3>
      <p>This was a simple Isometric game with a building and deleting mechanic, made for a school project. The map is generated from information provided by the user. The game has a fully controllable camera, controlled with WASD, and then the player moves with the arrow keys. Other controls include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To build - left click</li>
        <li>To move up - space bar</li>
        <li>To move down - shift key</li>
        <li>To swap material - press 1, 2 or 3</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If youâ€™re having trouble interacting with the embedded demo, <a href="https://brown1ie.github.io/WorldSpawner-Web-Demo/" target="_blank">click here</a> to open it in a new tab. The demo in general is quite buggy as it struggles with all the images being drawn on a web application. The program works much better once downloaded.</p>
