      <h3>Python Raycaster</h3>
      <p>For my computing A-level coursework, I created a raycasting project in python using the Pygame package and assets found online. Designed to replicate the rendering technique of Wolfenstein3D but have the visual style of DOOM 1993, my program has a unique visual design with customisable maps, modes and screen size.Whilst starting as a simple raycasting environment, I later added sprites, randomly generated maps, interactable areas of the map and more. This project achieved me nearly full marks for my coursework.</p>

      <h3>Isometric Project</h3>
      <p>This was a simple Isometric game with a building and deleting mechanic, made for a school project. The map is generated from information provided by the user. The game has a fully controllable camera, controlled with WASD, and then the player moves with the arrow keys. Other controls include: </p>
      <ul> To build - left click</ul>
      <ul> To move up - space bar</ul>
      <ul> To move down - shift key</ul>
      <ul> To swap material - press 1, 2 or 3</ul>
