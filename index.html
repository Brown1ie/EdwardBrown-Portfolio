      <h3>Python Raycaster</h3>
      <p>For my computing A-level coursework, I created a raycasting project in python using the Pygame package and assets found online. Whilst starting as a simple raycasting environment, I later added sprites, randomly generated maps, interactable areas of the map and more. This project achieved me nearly full marks for my coursework.</p>

      <h3>Isometric Project</h3>
      <p>This was a simple Isometric game with a building and deleting mechanic, made for a school project. The map is generated from information provided by the user. The game has a fully controllable camera, controlled with WASD, and then the player moves with the arrow keys. Other controls include: </p>
      <ul> <p> To build - left click</p></ul>
      <ul> <p> To move up - space bar</p></ul>
      <ul> <p> To move down - shift key</p></ul>
      <ul> <p> To swap material - press 1, 2 or 3</p></ul>
